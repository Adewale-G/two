  # Fix user_posts table and foreign key constraints

  1. Changes
    - Update user_posts table to use proper UUID foreign key for author_id
    - Fix foreign key constraint to reference profiles table
    - Update existing sample posts to use proper UUIDs
    - Ensure RLS policies work correctly

  2. Security
    - Maintain existing RLS policies
    - Ensure proper access control for posts
